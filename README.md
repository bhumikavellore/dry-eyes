# Dry Eyes Detection Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to detect dry eyes using machine learning techniques. A survey was conducted to gather data, which was then curated to form a dataset. An ensemble hybrid model was applied to this dataset, resulting in highly accurate predictions. The accompanying research paper provides a detailed analysis of the methodologies and results.

## Features
- Data Collection and Curation
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Training using Ensemble Hybrid Model
- Evaluation of Model Performance
- PDF of Jupyter Notebook
- Research Paper

- Required Python libraries 

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bhumikaveluru/dry-eyes-detection.git
cd dry-eyes-detection
```



## Usage
To use this project:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
2. Navigate to `Dry_Eyes_Detection.ipynb` and open it.
3. Run the notebook cells step-by-step to see the data processing, model training, and evaluation process.

## Data
The dataset used in this project was created based on survey responses to specific questions related to dry eyes. Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly as described in the notebook.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Conducted a survey to gather responses.
2. **Data Curation**: Cleaned and curated the survey data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Prepared the data for machine learning.
4. **Model Training**: Trained an ensemble hybrid model on the curated dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of the model using various metrics.
6. **Visualization**: Visualized the results using appropriate charts and graphs.

## Results
The model achieved high accuracy in predicting dry eyes. Key performance metrics include:
- **Accuracy**: 93%
